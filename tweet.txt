whats a closure?
#python3
A closure is a function that has reference to a locally scoped value
defined within its enviroment.
Too much grammer right? Lets go into it

For you to understand a closure you hve to 
understand what a nested fuction is, and what 
local scope and global scope is

function print_msg is nested in fuction do_something
and can access the variable (non local variable) msg enclosed in its parent
function do_something. simple right?


to define a closure, instead of executing the function in the enclosing scope
we return it like so. Warning: do not call the returned
function with ()

so the value passed in through square is not fogotten even after program excution
has passed that line.

to be sure even if we re-assign square a new value say 1 squared one still has its value
so good to be true right?


all functions has a closure attribute in python that returns a tuple of cell
object if the fuction is really a closure.
we can also access the cell content(stored variables) like so.
sweet right?


we cant just stop there right now!
when to use closures?
i would use closures in place of a one method class
with very few variables. This is because a closure remembers its
values remember. so i could literally make diffrent instances using
this technique like so.


another use of closure is to provide abstarction of data

lastly closure is not just a python thing.
